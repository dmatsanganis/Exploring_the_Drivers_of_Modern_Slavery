# The exploration of Modern Slavery

The exploration of modern slavery poses a significant and urgent challenge that necessitates the use of advanced analytical methods and state-of-the-art technologies. As such, the examination of modern slavery has been designated as the second assignment in the Analytics Practicum I (Python) course, which forms an integral part of the MSc in Business Analytics program offered by the Department of Management Science and Technology at the Athens University of Economics and Business.

The current assignment has been inspired by one study, that has appeared in the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/). The authors - researchers of the study, have been trying to estimate the prevalence of modern slavery, as well as factors that can help with this prediction. Machine Learning techniques can help in this endeavour, as has been shown through the following study:

* [Lavelle-Hill, R., Smith, G., Mazumder, A. et al. Machine learning methods for "wicked" problems: exploring the complex drivers of modern slavery. Humanities and Social Sciences Communications 8, 274 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00938-z)

More specifically, in the above-mentioned paper titled "Machine learning methods for 'wicked' problems: exploring the complex drivers of modern slavery" Lavelle-Hill et al. aim to explore the complex drivers of modern slavery by using machine learning methods to identify patterns and predictors of modern slavery.

Through the abstract of the paper we can identify that **modern slavery** is a complex and challenging issue to study, with data scarcity and high dimensionality impeding efforts to isolate and assess the importance of individual drivers statistically. However, recent advances in non-parametric computational methods offer scope to better capture the complex nature of modern slavery. In a study that models the prevalence of slavery in 48 countries, non-linear machine-learning models and strict cross-validation methods were combined with novel variable importance techniques, emphasising the importance of stability of model explanations via a Rashomon-set analysis.

The results of the study highlighted the importance of new predictive factors, such as a country's capacity to protect the physical security of women, which had been previously under-emphasised in quantitative models. Further analyses uncovered that women are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in areas where there is poor access to resources. The model was then leveraged to produce new out-of-sample estimates of slavery prevalence for countries where no survey data currently exists, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers seeking to combat modern slavery. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods to identify patterns and predictors of complex social problems such as modern slavery.

While the current analysis will be done on [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and in [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).
